Rubric (1 = Unacceptable → 5 = Exceptional)
Category 1 — Unacceptable 2 — Needs Work 3 — Meets Expectations 4 — Exceeds Expectations 5 — Exceptional
Design (UI/UX) Inconsistent layout; illegible or inaccessible; no mobile support. Basic responsiveness; noticeable visual bugs; limited attention to a11y. Clean, consistent UI; mobile‑friendly; passes basic a11y checks (contrast, keyboard nav). Thoughtful visual hierarchy; custom theming; comprehensive a11y (screen‑reader flows). Pixel‑perfect, branded design; motion/interaction polish; formal a11y audit with fixes.
Frontend Implementation Frequent runtime errors; spaghetti code; no state mgmt conventions. Works but brittle; large components; ad‑hoc state handling. Modular components; state handled via TanStack Query/RHF; minimal warnings. Well‑typed hooks; code‑splitting; performance optimizations (lazy‑load, memo). Production‑level quality: SSR/SEO, exhaustive error states, lighthouse ~90+.
Backend / API Endpoints fail or are missing; insecure rules; no validation. CRUD works but poor error handling; some validation gaps. tRPC routes typed; Zod validation; Firestore rules enforce auth. Thoughtful data modelling; composite indexes; graceful failures. Multi‑env config; seeding scripts; zero‑downtime migrations or blue‑green deploys.
Dev Experience & CI/CD Manual builds; no linter/tests in pipeline; flaky deploys. Basic GitHub Action to deploy; tests run locally only. Turbo‑cached pipeline: lint, type‑check, tests, Storybook build, preview deploy. Parallel jobs, test reports, codecov; deploy promotes on tag/Changeset. Cache‑aware, <5 min runtime; canary deploys; Slack/Discord notifications & rollbacks.
Cloud / IT Ops Hard‑coded secrets; no monitoring; unclear infra costs. Env vars in repo secrets; basic Firebase console logs. Secrets via T3 Env + functions:config; Cloud Logging dashboards. Alerting rules, Crashlytics/Sentry integration; cost budgets. IaC or scripts for full recreate; autoscaling tuned; custom metrics & alerts.
Product Management No clear goals; scope creep; missing acceptance criteria. Trello/Issues exist but vague; ad‑hoc prioritization. Defined MVP; backlog groomed; demo accepts against criteria. Road‑map with milestones; burn‑down chart; stakeholder demos. Data‑driven decisions (analytics); retro action items implemented; public changelog.
Quality & Testing No automated tests; manual QA only. <30 % unit coverage; flaky E2E; lint disabled. ≥60 % unit+component coverage; Playwright happy path; lint & Prettier pass CI. Visual regression via Storybook; a11y checks; seed data resets; ≥80 % coverage. Mutation or property‑based tests; contract/fuzz tests; zero‑regression policy.
Security Public DB; default rules; secrets in code. Auth enforced but rules overly broad; no dependency scanning. Principle‑of‑least‑privilege rules; OWASP top‑10 reviewed; secrets managed. Automated security tests (ZAP/GH Dependabot); 2FA enforced on repo. Threat model documented; security ADRs; periodic penetration test results.
Architecture & Code Organization Single huge file; unclear boundaries; no ADRs. Ad‑hoc folders; circular deps; inconsistent naming. Follows monorepo layout; shared package for types; ADR in /docs. Decoupled modules; clear domain boundaries; tree‑shakeable libraries. Hexagonal/CQRS or similar advanced patterns; plug‑in architecture; exemplary ADR trail.
